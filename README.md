# Password Generator

This program is a simple yet powerful password generator. It allows you to create a password of your desired length and complexity.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user is prompted to enter the desired password length and preferences for character types. This includes whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters.

2. **Password Generation**: The `generate_password` function takes these inputs and begins the process of creating the password.

    - **Character Selection**: A string of potential characters is constructed by concatenating the appropriate character sets based on the user's preferences. This could include `string.ascii_uppercase` for uppercase letters, `string.digits` for numbers, etc.

    - **Random Selection**: The password is generated by randomly selecting characters from the potential characters string. These are then joined into a single string of the desired length.

3. **Output**: The generated password is then printed to the console, providing the user with a strong, random password that fits their specified criteria.

## Usage

To use this program, simply run it in your Python environment, follow the prompts, and receive your generated password!
